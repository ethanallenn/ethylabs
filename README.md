Terve, Hi, Hei, Hej, Hæ, Labas, 今日は 👋

🌱 I'm Ethan, and I'm from Northern Ireland (which, is in the UK).

🔭 I code in a lot of languages, just whatever comes to my head first: C#, Java, Pyhton, Lua - anything.

📫 If you're looking to contact me, I'm on Discord at ethy#3550 or email at ethylabs@programmer.net.

👯 My main project is my Minecraft Fabric Plugin.
