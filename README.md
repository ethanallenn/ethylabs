Hi, Hei, Hej, 今日は 👋

🌱 I'm Ethan, and I'm from Northern Ireland.

🔭 I code in a lot of languages, just whatever comes to my head first: C#, Java, Python - anything.

📫 If you're looking to contact me, I'm on Discord at Ethai#5330 or email at ethan@ethainet.co.uk.

👯 My main project is a minecraft server that will be released in Late 2023.
